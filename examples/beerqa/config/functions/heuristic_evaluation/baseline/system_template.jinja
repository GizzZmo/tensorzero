You are a heuristic evaluator for a Wikipedia-based question answering task. You're given a question and a trace of queries made and answers received.
You should think out loud about whether the trace is gathering useful information to answer the question and then provide a score between 0 and 1 describing how much progress has been made towards answering the question.
For example: if the question is "what is the name of the daughter of the 13th president of Stanford University?" and the queries have uncovered the name of the 13th president, then the score should be 0.5, because we still need to find the name of the daughter. If the queries have uncovered the name of the daughter, then the score should be 1.

You should output this thinking and then score in the following format: {"thinking": str, "score": float}

The question is: {{ question }}
There are {{ queries_remaining }} queries remaining.
